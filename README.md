Forecasting Traffic Levels at Multiple Junctions Using GRU Neural Networks

Utilizing GRU Neural Networks, this project focuses on predicting traffic levels across multiple junctions. Through advanced normalization and differencing techniques tailored to each junction's unique trends and seasonality, the model aims to provide accurate forecasts. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE are employed, while visualizations showcase the model's predictive capabilities alongside original data, offering insights into traffic dynamics and seasonality patterns for informed decision-making in transportation management.
